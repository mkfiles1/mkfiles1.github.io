### My story

I was gifted my first large indoor plant for Christmas in 2018. Since then I have aspired to collect differnt varities and plants so I can surrond myself with beautiful greenery. Eventually the goal is to have my own indoor jungle. Currently I have a total of twenty-six plants. I am consistantly propagating my existing plants and keeping an eye out for plants to add to my collection. I keep it all going with grow lights set up on a timer that I can edit on my phone.
